                <h1>Contour 556 is Canberra's biennial public art festival <span class="created-by"><br>by Neil Hobbs.</span></h1>
                <p>Contour 556 is the water level of Lake Burley Griffin, which links the event in name as well as in purpose to the history of the central Canberra landscape. The artworks and installations selected for the festival respond in some way to
                    Canberra’s history, from 50,000 years to the present day. contour 556 will therefore offer the Canberra, Australian and international community a unique opportunity to engage with and understand the layers of Canberra’s history through
                    art.
