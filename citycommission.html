                    arts industry support; and to identify ongoing and emergent needs of the arts sector. contour 556 is delivering the City Commissions project on behalf of artsACT. </p>

                <h3>PROJECT OUTLINE</h3>
                <p>Contour 556 is commissioning works from three artists: Alison Alder, Michael Sollis, and Sammy Hawker.</p>
            </section>
            <p>The City Commissions project tasks three artists with exploring the identity of the city as it is expressed through the contribution of community organisations. </p>
            <p>The artists will experience new collaborative opportunities, working closely with contour 556, artsACT and the community organisations to develop/install/perform/deliver their artwork. </p>
            <section>
                <h3>Project objectives and values</h3>
            </section>
            <p>Through artsACT, the program has a dual focus – recovery and resilience. Recovery can occur with a return to public engagement and resumption of activities, supported by public funding. Resilience will grow the capabilities of arts practitioners
                and take advantage of other forms of engagement that have emerged due to the technological and societal changes caused by our response to the pandemic. </p>
            <p>The specific outcomes of the project are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To deliver tangible benefits to the artist through connection with the mentor</li>
                <li>To develop artist skills and experience</li>
                <li>To develop experience on working on a commissioned work</li>
                <li>To deliver tangible benefits to the community groups and the artists.</li>
                <li>To establish and maintain cultural safety</li>
                <li>To be environmentally and socially sustainable</li>
